# COMELEC 2025 Election Results Scraper (PH)

This Python project is a scraper and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline designed to gather precinct-level election results from the [COMELEC 2025 election results site](https://2025electionresults.comelec.gov.ph). It drills down from regions to precincts and extracts actual vote counts for senators and party-lists. 

Will probably expand this in the future for local election data.

## ‚úÖ Features

- Extracts Philippine election data by locality (region ‚Üí precinct)
- Fetches precinct-level vote counts (summary, senators, party-lists)
- Modular ETL structure
- Real-time CSV writing (memory-efficient)
- Automatically resumes from last saved point

---

## üì¶ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `requests`

Install via:

```bash
pip install pandas requests
```

üöÄ How It Works

**Step 1: Extract Locality Hierarchy**

```python
main()
```

This function:

- Fetches and saves regional ‚Üí provincial ‚Üí city ‚Üí barangay ‚Üí precinct data
- Outputs to:
  - `regions.csv`
  - `provinces.csv`
  - `cities.csv`
  - `baranggays.csv`
  - `precincts.csv`

Each level is fetched through the COMELEC‚Äôs API structure.

**Step 2: Extract Precinct-Level Vote Data**
```python
transform_er_data()
```
This function:

- Reads `precincts.csv` to determine the list of precincts
- Skips precincts already processed using `check_data()` function.
- Still works when process is interrupted
- For each precinct, it fetches:
  - General vote data (registered, actual, valid ballots)
  - Senator-level votes
  - Party-list votes
- Outputs are written to the `data` folder:
  - `precinct_info.csv`
  - `precinct_senators.csv`
  - `precinct_partylist.csv`

**Step 3: Clean and collate data into a single document (each)**
```python
pending, parties, senators = check_data()
if len(pending) == 0:
    collate(parties, senators)
```
This function:

- calls `check_data()` before calling the `collate()` 
- saves the following files to `data` folder:
  - `precinct_senators.csv`
  - `precinct_partylist.csv`

üìÑ **Output Files**

| File                          | Description                          |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `./geo/regions.csv`           | Region-level locality info           |
| `./geo/provinces.csv`         | Provinces under each region          |
| `./geo/cities.csv`            | Cities and municipalities            |
| `./geo/baranggays.csv`        | Barangays under each city            |
| `./geo/precincts.csv`         | List of precincts per barangay       |
| `./data/precinct_info.csv`    | Summary info per precinct            |
| `./data/precinct_senators.csv`| Senatorial vote count per precinct   |
| `./data/precinct_partylist.csv`| Party-list vote count per precinct   |

üß™ **Future Improvements**

- Upload the raw CSV files for people to use in their own ETL projects
- Make a Script to transform and load data to a more efficient and clean database (I will probably use MySQL).
- Make own data analysis and create a dashboard
- Document the entire process properly, maybe deploy the results online.
- Add better error handling and retry logic
- Add multiprocessing to speed up extraction
